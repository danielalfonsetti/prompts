I want to create a [...]


For the backend:
 - Use python
 - Use FastAPI as the webserver. 
 - Use polars if you need to do dataframe manipulation

For the frontend: 
 - Use vite
 - use typescript
 - use react


The frontend and backend should both be using docker. Use docker-compose to compose the frontend and backend together.

Use pixi for environment management rather than e.g. venv.

During development, I want both the frontend and backend to hot-reload. I'm not quite sure how this works with docker, maybe in dev they are not running in docker? I'm not sure.
